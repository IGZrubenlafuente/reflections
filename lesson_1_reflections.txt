    Easy, as it only shows the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    I'll have control over all the changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git is better, because I don't need to track every keystroke I make

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A development step normally involves more than 1 file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    This way we will see who is to blame for some mistake

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'll have no worries at all
